# KittyTree

This simple page displays the ancestry of your kittys. It does so by querying
the CryptoKitty-API and loading all the kittys' data, displaying it in a nice
[Treant](http://fperucic.github.io/treant-js/) visualization.

Be warned, if you query for higher generation kittys there will be a lot of data
loaded wich could potentially get you blocked by the CryptoKitty server and it
could crash your browser(tab) because of the amount of cute kittys.

If you like this, I have nothing against gifted kittys or ethers:
